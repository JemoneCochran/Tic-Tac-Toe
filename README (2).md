## Usage/Examples

#imported functions 

#This function allows the user to use selected functions that make game creating easier!

#We specifically used the "*" function as it will give the most commonly used functions for this code

    from tkinter import *

#Another function was added to the program because this function let's the program create random outcomes at whichever limit we choose, it's possible to add more than one function to the program

    import random


#This function defines a functions for each players turn, the boards, the win conditions and rounds or new games to be created

    def next_turn(row, column):

#The primarily used variable, it's set to player to reference player 1
#a "global" variable is a variable that can be used throughout the entire program

    global player

#the if statements (labelled "if") that will declare specific text based on information from the "check_winner" function

    if buttons[row][column]['text'] == "" and check_winner() is False:

    if player == players[0]:

        buttons[row][column]['text'] = player

 #if statements that will display the appropriate text on the tic tac toe board

    if check_winner() is False:
    
        player = players[1]
                label.config(text=(players[1]+" turn"))

            elif check_winner() is True:
                label.config(text=(players[0]+" wins"))

            elif check_winner() == "Tie":
                label.config(text="Tie!")

        else:
